I"d<p>This project aims to classify chest CT scans into different categories, such as adenocarcinoma and normal cases, using deep learning techniques. The model is built using TensorFlow and trained on a variety of chest CT images to achieve high accuracy and performance. The comprehensive details of this project can be explored on my <a href="https://github.com/drjodyannjones/End-to-End-Cancer-Classification-Project" target="\_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>I designed the “End-to-End Cancer Classification Project” to apply deep learning algorithms in the accurate classification of medical imaging, thereby increasing diagnostic precision. This system is intended to assist healthcare professionals by providing quicker and more accurate assessments, which are crucial in the treatment planning stages. The frontend framework was created with Gradio</p>

<h3 id="technologies-employed">Technologies Employed</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Python:</strong> I used Python for developing machine learning algorithms and for data manipulation.</li>
  <li><strong>TensorFlow and Keras:</strong> These tools were essential in building and training the deep learning models.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenCV:</strong> This library was utilized for processing images, preparing them for the training process.</li>
  <li><strong>Jupyter Notebook:</strong> I documented the development and testing phases using Jupyter Notebook, which facilitated a clear presentation of the methodologies and results.</li>
</ul>
