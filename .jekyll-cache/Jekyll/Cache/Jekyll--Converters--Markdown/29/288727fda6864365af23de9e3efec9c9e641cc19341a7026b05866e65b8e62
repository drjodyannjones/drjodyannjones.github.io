I"!<p>The <strong>End-to-End Cancer Classification App</strong> utilizes TensorFlow to train a binary classification model on a dataset of chest CT images. Images are categorized in two classes: adenocarcinoma and normal cases. Using a pre-trained, base model, VGG16, I built a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that assigns images to either class. The model is accessible through a frontend using the Gradio framework, which features an intuitive, user-friendly interface allowing for straightforward interactions, such as image uploads or direct pasting from the web or local storage. Detailed information about this project is available on my <a href="https://github.com/drjodyannjones/End-to-End-Cancer-Classification-Project" target="\_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>This project was conceived to harness the power of deep learning algorithms for the precise classification of medical imaging, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy. One significant application of this model is to support healthcare professionals, such as radiologists, by offering faster and more precise assessments critical during the treatment planning phase.</p>

<p>Beyond its initial application in aiding radiologists, the potential of the project extends to several other fields. For instance, it could be adapted for use in pathology to enhance the detection and analysis of histopathological slides, significantly speeding up the process of diagnosing diseases at the cellular level. Additionally, the model could be utilized in emergency medicine to quickly analyze images in critical care settings, facilitating faster decision-making where time is of the essence. Furthermore, its adaptability means it could also support research in epidemiology by providing insights into disease patterns and prevalence through large-scale image analysis, thereby contributing to public health strategies and preventive medicine. This breadth of applications highlights the versatility and impact of advanced machine learning models in various aspects of healthcare and research.</p>
