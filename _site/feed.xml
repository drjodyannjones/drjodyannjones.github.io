<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>This project was conceived to harness the power of deep learning algorithms for the precise classification of medical imaging, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy. One significant application of this model is to support healthcare professionals, such as radiologists, by offering faster and more precise assessments critical during the treatment planning phase.</p>

<p>Beyond its initial application in aiding radiologists, the potential of the project extends to several other fields. For instance, it could be adapted for use in pathology to enhance the detection and analysis of histopathological slides, significantly speeding up the process of diagnosing diseases at the cellular level. Additionally, the model could be utilized in emergency medicine to quickly analyze images in critical care settings, facilitating faster decision-making where time is of the essence. Furthermore, its adaptability means it could also support research in epidemiology by providing insights into disease patterns and prevalence through large-scale image analysis, thereby contributing to public health strategies and preventive medicine. This breadth of applications highlights the versatility and impact of advanced machine learning models in various aspects of healthcare and research.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>The <strong>Real Estate Data Engineering</strong> project leverages cutting-edge data processing technologies to generate actionable insights from comprehensive real estate datasets. This initiative enhances decision-making capabilities for stakeholders by providing sophisticated tools for analyzing market trends, property valuations, and investment opportunities in real-time. By integrating real-time data streaming with advanced analytical processes, this project supports a wide range of applications, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Market Trend Analysis</strong>: Analysts can detect market shifts and emerging trends as they happen, enabling faster strategic responses.</li>
  <li><strong>Investment Decision Support</strong>: Investors gain access to up-to-date information on property values and market conditions, aiding in better investment choices.</li>
  <li><strong>Portfolio Management</strong>: Real estate companies can manage their assets more effectively by having current data at their fingertips, facilitating better operational and financial decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: By analyzing current and historical data trends, risks associated with investments can be better assessed and mitigated.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project exemplifies the power of integrating multiple technologies to transform raw data into a valuable strategic asset, driving forward the capabilities of real estate market analytics.</p>

<h3 id="technologies-employed">Technologies Employed</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Python:</strong> Used for scripting data collection, transformation, and aggregation processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Apache Spark:</strong> Employed to efficiently manage large-scale data processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Docker:</strong> Applied to containerize the development environment to ensure consistency across different platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Apache Kafka</strong> A cluster of Apache Kafka brokers used as the conduit to transmit data from the source to sink with low latency.</li>
  <li><strong>Brightdata API</strong> I setup a Brightdata web scraper to seamlessly web scrape real estate listings in the UK from Zoopla’s website.</li>
  <li><strong>CassandraDB</strong> A NoSQL database designed to manage large amounts of data. This is our sink</li>
  <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> This helps with the querying of property listings on Zoopla’s website.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>Step 1. Clone the repository to your local machine:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/drjodyannjones/RealEstateDataEngineering.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Step 2. Building Docker Image:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker build <span class="nt">-t</span> my-custom-spark:3.5.0 <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Step 3. Start Docker Container (make sure the Docker client is up and running on your machine first!)</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker compose up <span class="nt">-d</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Step 3. Start Data Ingestion process:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python main.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Step 4. Start Spark Consumer:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker <span class="nb">exec</span> <span class="nt">-it</span> realestatedataengineering-spark-master-1 spark-submit <span class="se">\</span>

Jones</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this project, I designed and implemented a real-time streaming end-to-end data engineering pipeline that captures real estate listings from Zoopla using the BrightData API. The data flows through a Kafka cluster, a message broker, which effectively manages the movement of data from the source to the storage system (sink), in this case, Cassandra DB. Utilizing Apache Spark, the pipeline handles large-scale data processing efficiently. This setup is specifically engineered to optimize real estate market analysis, providing a robust tool for dynamic and precise market evaluation. For an in-depth look at the project, you are welcome to visit my GitHub repository. Project Overview The Real Estate Data Engineering project leverages cutting-edge data processing technologies to generate actionable insights from comprehensive real estate datasets. This initiative enhances decision-making capabilities for stakeholders by providing sophisticated tools for analyzing market trends, property valuations, and investment opportunities in real-time. By integrating real-time data streaming with advanced analytical processes, this project supports a wide range of applications, including: Market Trend Analysis: Analysts can detect market shifts and emerging trends as they happen, enabling faster strategic responses. Investment Decision Support: Investors gain access to up-to-date information on property values and market conditions, aiding in better investment choices. Portfolio Management: Real estate companies can manage their assets more effectively by having current data at their fingertips, facilitating better operational and financial decisions. Risk Management: By analyzing current and historical data trends, risks associated with investments can be better assessed and mitigated. This project exemplifies the power of integrating multiple technologies to transform raw data into a valuable strategic asset, driving forward the capabilities of real estate market analytics. Technologies Employed Python: Used for scripting data collection, transformation, and aggregation processes. Apache Spark: Employed to efficiently manage large-scale data processing. Docker: Applied to containerize the development environment to ensure consistency across different platforms. Apache Kafka A cluster of Apache Kafka brokers used as the conduit to transmit data from the source to sink with low latency. Brightdata API I setup a Brightdata web scraper to seamlessly web scrape real estate listings in the UK from Zoopla’s website. CassandraDB A NoSQL database designed to manage large amounts of data. This is our sink OpenAI This helps with the querying of property listings on Zoopla’s website. Getting Started Installation Step 1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/drjodyannjones/RealEstateDataEngineering.git Step 2. Building Docker Image: docker build -t my-custom-spark:3.5.0 . Step 3. Start Docker Container (make sure the Docker client is up and running on your machine first!) docker compose up -d Step 3. Start Data Ingestion process: python main.py Step 4.
